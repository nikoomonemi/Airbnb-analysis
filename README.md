Airbnb Dataset Analysis
-  Overview
This analysis explores key variables that influence the price of Airbnb listings, including neighborhood, room type, and number of reviews. Understanding these relationships helps identify the main factors affecting rental prices.
-  Neighborhood:
The neighborhood variable has a strong impact on price.
Based on the dataset, listings located in Manhattan generally have the highest average prices, while those in the Bronx tend to have the lowest.
This pattern aligns with real-world expectations, as Manhattan is one of the most desirable and central areas in New York City.
- Room Type:
The room type variable also significantly affects pricing:
Entire homes/apartments have the highest prices among all room types.
Private rooms are priced lower than entire homes but higher than shared rooms.
This shows that as privacy and space increase, the price tends to rise.
-  Number of Reviews:
When analyzing the number of reviews, the relationship with price is less direct.
In general, listings with higher prices tend to have fewer reviews, likely because they are less affordable, and therefore fewer guests stay there.
Conversely, lower-priced listings often have more reviews, as they attract more guests who are more likely to leave feedback.
Thus, while price and number of reviews are somewhat related, the relationship is indirect and may also depend on other factors like location, availability, and property type.
- Summary:
In summary:
Neighborhood and room type have a strong and clear effect on price.
Number of reviews shows an inverse relationship with price, but this effect is less consistent.
These findings highlight that location and property characteristics are the main drivers of Airbnb pricing.
